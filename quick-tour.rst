Now that you know :doc:`a little bit about TestBal <intro>`, let's take it for a spin! 

------------------
Install TestBal
------------------
Download TestBal from http://www.foo.org and unzip it on your computer.

Run HelloWorld

This sample will show you how easy it is to run testBal, send it a request, and get a response. The HelloWorld sample doesn't take any specific input, so simply running it will cause it to print "Hello, World!" at the command line.

At the command prompt, enter the following line::

  testbal run helloworld.bal

You will see the following response::

  Hello, World!
  
You just started TestBal, ran the HelloWorld sample, and got a response within seconds. Let's take a look at what the sample looks like in the testBal::
